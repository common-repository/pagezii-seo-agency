Pagezii SEO Agency lets Digital Marketing agencies offer a simple way for website visitors to automatically create SEO, UX and Social audit PDF reports for their domains.

== Description ==

Pagezii SEO Agency is a plugin that allows Digital Marketing agencies to offer automated SEO, UX and Social audits to their website visitors. It automatically creates a preliminary audit PDF for a domain provided by the visitor. The PDF takes a few minutes to generate and is automatically emailed to the visitor. A copy of the PDF is also emailed to the Agency for reference. The Agency can then reach out to the visitor to consult and develop as a client.
